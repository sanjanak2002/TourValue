# TourValue
Enhancing travel experience using Blockchain

## The problem TourValue solves
I have chosen the topic Open Innovation and under that I have taken Tourism. My main aim is to provide a wonderful experience to the tourists and the locals by integrating blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we travel. For this, I am considering four aspects:

1. Customer Identification - We can eliminate verification at multiple stages using Blockchain and hence saving time at multiple checkpoints.
2. Secure Transactions - We can use Cryptocurrency to pay directly between two parties without any third party online payment system.
3. Baggage Management - Blockchain data can be used to identify and monitor the luggage and stop worrying about mishandling.
4. Customer rewards and Ratings - Reward customer with cryptocurrency so that they are encouraged to do future travel plans with us. And as for ratings, nowadays we notice fake ratings increasing just to build the popularity of a particular service/product. Using blockchain, we could make sure that the ratings are transparent and true.
